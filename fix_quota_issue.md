# OpenAI Quota Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## The Problem
You're getting: "Error generating real companies: OpenAI API quota exceeded"

## Your Setup Status ✅
- ✅ API key is properly formatted (starts with `sk-proj-`)
- ✅ API key is loaded correctly from `.env` file
- ✅ OpenAI library is installed and working

## Root Cause
The error is a **quota/billing issue**, not a configuration problem.

## Solutions (Try in this order):

### 1. Check Your OpenAI Account Billing
Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Verify you have a payment method added
- Check if you have available credits
- Look for any billing alerts

### 2. Check Usage Limits
Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/limits
- See your current usage vs. limits
- Check if you've hit daily/monthly limits

### 3. Check Current Usage
Visit: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
- See how much you've used this month
- Check if you're close to your limit

### 4. Common Issues & Fixes:

**Free Tier Exhausted:**
- Free tier has $5 credit that expires after 3 months
- Solution: Add a payment method

**Rate Limits:**
- Even with billing, there are rate limits
- Solution: Wait a few minutes and try again

**Model Access:**
- Some models require higher tier access
- Solution: Try `gpt-3.5-turbo` instead of `gpt-4`

**New Account Restrictions:**
- New accounts may have lower limits
- Solution: Wait 24-48 hours or add billing

### 5. Quick Test Commands:

```bash
# Test with minimal request
py test_quota_simple.py

# Check your API key status
py quick_test.py
```

### 6. Alternative Solutions:

**Use a different model:**
Try changing the model in your code from `gpt-4` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` (cheaper)

**Reduce request frequency:**
Add delays between API calls

**Use smaller requests:**
Reduce `max_tokens` in your requests

## Next Steps:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add a payment method if you haven't
3. Check your usage at https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
4. Try the test script again

The error is definitely a billing/quota issue, not a technical configuration problem!
